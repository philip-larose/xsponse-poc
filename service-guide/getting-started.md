# Getting Started with XSPONSE

You manage your XSPONSE service through the XSPONSE website, which provides a dashboard through which you can access each of these components. The site features a consistent look and feel, with every page providing the same base functions, to make navigation easier. See the Dashboard section for more information.

## Setting up your administrator account

To start, you will need to have at least one administrator user account. The administratorâ€™s role is to manage the other user accounts on the system. (Administrators can also perform all the other tasks that regular users can do.) If no one is set up as an administrator, please contact your installer to get an administrator account created. We will send you an email with a link to the XSPONSE site, where you will be required to set a password for your new account, using your email address as the username. Once you have set a password, you will be redirected to log in to the site.

Once the administrator account is created, the administrator can send invitations to other employees to add them to the system. These invitations work in the same fashion, providing a link to the XSPONSE site where the employee will be required to set a password and then be redirected to log in. You should have your administrator create all the other new accounts within an organization, as the administrator will have the best understanding of how your company should be using the system. See the Users section for more information.
